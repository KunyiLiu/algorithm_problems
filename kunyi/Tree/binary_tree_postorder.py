# Push the root node to the first stack.
# Pop a node from the first stack, and push it to the second stack.
# Then push its left child followed by its right child to the first stack.
# Repeat step 2) and 3) until the first stack is empty.
# Once done, the second stack would have all the nodes ready to be traversed in post-order. Pop off the nodes from the second stack one by one and youâ€™re done.
